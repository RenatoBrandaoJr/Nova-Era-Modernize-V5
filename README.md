# Nova Era Modernize V5

This is a SaaS template based on the Modernize Bootstrap 5 Admin Template. It provides a starting point for building modern web applications with a pre-built user interface.

## Overview

This project uses a Gulp-based build system to compile assets and serve the application locally. The main source code for the template is located within the `package/starterkit/src` directory.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend Framework:** Bootstrap 5
*   **Templating:** HTML (with `gulp-file-include` for partials)
*   **Styling:** SCSS (compiled to CSS)
*   **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS (potentially with libraries copied via `gulp-npm-dist`)
*   **Build Tool:** Gulp
*   **Package Manager:** npm

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2.  **Navigate to Starterkit:** Open your terminal and change the directory to the core template folder:
    ```bash
    cd "package/starterkit"
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the following command to install the necessary Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(Note: The `preinstall` script `npx npm-force-resolutions` might run first)*

## Running Locally (Development)

1.  **Navigate to Starterkit:** Make sure you are in the `package/starterkit` directory in your terminal.
2.  **Start Development Server:** Run the default Gulp task:
    ```bash
    npx gulp
    ```
    This command will:
    *   Compile SCSS to CSS.
    *   Process HTML files (including partials).
    *   Start a local development server using BrowserSync.
    *   Open the application in your default browser.
    *   Watch for changes in HTML and SCSS files and automatically reload the browser.

## Building for Production

1.  **Navigate to Starterkit:** Make sure you are in the `package/starterkit` directory in your terminal.
2.  **Run Build Task:** Execute the Gulp build command:
    ```bash
    npx gulp build
    ```
    This will create (or overwrite) the `dist` folder in the **root** directory (`/Users/renatobrandao/Documents/Nova Era modernize V5/dist`) with the optimized and production-ready files (compiled CSS, processed HTML, minified JS, copied assets, etc.).
