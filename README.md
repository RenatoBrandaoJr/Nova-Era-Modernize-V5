# Nova Era Modernize V5

This is a SaaS template based on the Modernize Bootstrap 5 Admin Template. It provides a starting point for building modern web applications with a pre-built user interface.

## Overview

This project uses a Gulp-based build system to compile assets and serve the application locally. It contains two main working directories within the `package` folder:

*   `package/starterkit`: Use this for building a **new application** based on the template or for **customizing the core framework**.
*   `package/demos`: Use this to run the **pre-built demo applications** as shown in the official documentation.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend Framework:** Bootstrap 5
*   **Templating:** HTML (with `gulp-file-include` for partials)
*   **Styling:** SCSS (compiled to CSS)
*   **JavaScript:** Vanilla JS (potentially with libraries copied via `gulp-npm-dist`)
*   **Build Tool:** Gulp
*   **Package Manager:** npm

## Installation & Running

Choose the instructions below based on your goal:

### Option 1: Developing a New Application (Using Starterkit)

Use these steps if you want to customize the core template or build your own application from the starter kit.

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2.  **Navigate to Starterkit:** Open your terminal and change the directory to the core template folder:
    ```bash
    cd "package/starterkit"
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the following command to install the necessary Node.js packages for the starter kit:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(Note: The `preinstall` script `npx npm-force-resolutions` might run first)*

**Running Starterkit Locally (Development Mode):**

1.  **Navigate to Starterkit:** Make sure you are in the `package/starterkit` directory in your terminal.
2.  **Start Development Server:** Run the default Gulp task:
    ```bash
    npx gulp
    ```
    This command will:
    *   Compile SCSS to CSS.
    *   Process HTML files (including partials).
    *   Start a local development server using BrowserSync.
    *   Open the starter kit application in your default browser.
    *   Watch for changes in HTML and SCSS files and automatically reload the browser.

**Building Starterkit for Production:**

1.  **Navigate to Starterkit:** Make sure you are in the `package/starterkit` directory in your terminal.
2.  **Run Build Task:** Execute the Gulp build command:
    ```bash
    npx gulp build
    ```
    This will create (or overwrite) the `dist` folder in the **project root** directory (`/Users/renatobrandao/Documents/Nova Era modernize V5/dist`) with the optimized and production-ready files based on the starter kit.

### Option 2: Running Pre-built Demos

Use these steps if you want to view and run the pre-built demo applications included with the template, as described in the official documentation.

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  **Navigate to Demos:** Open your terminal and change the directory to the demos folder:
    ```bash
    cd "package/demos"
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the following command to install the necessary Node.js packages for the demos:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **(Optional) Install Gulp Globally:** If you haven't already, the documentation recommends installing the Gulp command-line interface globally (you might need `sudo` on macOS/Linux):
    ```bash
    npm install --global gulp-cli
    ```
5.  **Start Demos Server:** Run the default Gulp task from the `package/demos` directory:
    ```bash
    gulp
    ```
    *(Note: If you didn't install gulp-cli globally, you might need to run `npx gulp` instead)*.
    This will start a local server, likely running the demo applications.

**Building Demos for Production:**

1.  **Navigate to Demos:** Make sure you are in the `package/demos` directory.
2.  **Run Build Task:** Execute the Gulp build command:
    ```bash
    gulp build
    ```
    *(or `npx gulp build`)*.
    Check the `gulpfile.js` within the `demos` directory to confirm where the build output is placed (it might also go to the root `dist` folder or a subfolder within `demos`).
